# CryptoClustering

## Project Description

Remember the halcyon days of October 2021, where you just _had_ to get into crypto? Your brother-in-law and other, more distant, relations telling you that this was the time to get in; that you had to buy now, because this thing was going "to the moon ðŸš€" I haven't checked in, but I assume they're all millionairs almost two years on.

Well, as we all know, if everyone around you is getting into a get-rich-quick scheme and it sounds too-good-to-be-true, then you'd better get in right now, because they're going to be rich and you're going to be left behind like a dummy.
