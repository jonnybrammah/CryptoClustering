## Project Description

Remember the halcyon days of October 2021, where you just _had_ to get into crypto? Your brother-in-law and other, more distant, relations telling you that this was the time to get in; that you had to buy now, because this thing was going "to the moon ðŸš€"?

I haven't checked in since then, but I assume they're all millionaires almost two years on.

As we all know, if everyone around you is getting into a get-rich-quick scheme and it sounds too-good-to-be-true, then you'd better get in right now, because they're going to be rich and on the moon ðŸš€ (?) and you're going to be left behind ðŸŒŽ like a dummy. But since you didn't get in then, let's analyze some coins right now - it's never too late to be a ~~rube~~ wealthy investor.

The goal of this project was to use machine learning algorithms
